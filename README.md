3 Spectral analysis with Fourier transforms

3.1 Overview of principles

The subject takes up the theoretical notions of the Fourier trans-
form as seen in mathematics and analytical physics classes. We will
aim to implement these codes in their current state: solving the Pois-
son equation on a grid with one (1D) or two (2D) dimensions, with
mesh = n or nx â‡¥ ny, respectively.

Material provided

The Python FFTW module pyFFTW can be installed with the pip util-
ity ; or, you may download and install it from the github repository
https://github.com/pyFFTW/pyFFTW. Examples how to use the pack-
age are given on the github page, and a notebook FFTW_ex.ipynb
is also available on the Ernest/moodle and Slack website for this
course.

Results / report

You will save your results/programmes on ENT in a directory called
M1-Projects. There you will store an archive of your source pro-
grammes and results; the compressed archive, however, cannot ex-
ceed 50 MB of memory space
